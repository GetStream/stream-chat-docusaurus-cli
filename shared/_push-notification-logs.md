The Stream [Dashboard](https://dashboard.getstream.io/app/APP_ID/chat/webhookpushlogs) includes logs that track the requests sent by Stream Chat API to Firebase or APN.

A new push log is created whenever the Stream API triggers the push delivery service, (i.e triggers the push delivery to provider(s) (Firebase/APN/Huawei/Xiaomi).

The API executes the push notification template and data template to APN or Firebase, and then relies on the provider to deliver the message to the device.

Select Push, and your preferences (Push Provider, Log level, Period):
![](./assets/push-logs-01.png)

The Logs include the

- **time** elapsed since the push happened
- **provider** for the push service
- **user ID** of the push receiver
- The **event type** that caused the push
- The **response status** from the provider

:::info
The response status indicates whether the provider received the push and does not indicate whether the user's device successfully received it. If the dashboard shows response statuses and users are reporting failed pushes, the defect is between the Push Provider and the User's device.
:::

When you select a log record, the dashboard shows extra details about the push.
