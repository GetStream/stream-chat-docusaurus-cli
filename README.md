# Stream Chat Docusaurus CLI

This is a CLI tool to help locally run docusaurus and show SDK documentation

## Installation and Using the CLI

To install the package follow the guide below:

```bash
# Clone the repository

git clone https://github.com/getstream/stream-chat-docusaurus-cli

# Move into the project directory

cd stream-chat-docusaurus-cli

# Run the install command

npm install -g
```

Within the same directory level of your SDK that the `docusaurus` directory described above lives you can run CLI commands. Make sure you have at least the directory structure described above as well as at least 1 markdown file.

### Starting

To run the site locally and see your documentation, run `npx stream-chat-docusaurus -s`.

### Environment variables

In order to run the searching functionality, you need to add the Algolia env vars in your `/docusaurus/.env` file. Please remember to add it to `.gitignore` and you can have a list of required variables in our `docusaurus/src/environment.js` file.

### Versioning

To cut a new version of your docs simply type in `npx stream-chat-docusaurus -nv NEW_VERSION SDK_NAME` like this (SDK_NAME all lowercase with no spaces): `npx stream-chat-docusaurus -nv 2.0.0-rc.0 reactnative`.

### Building

To build the site in production mode, run `npx stream-chat-docusaurus -b`. The `-b` flag builds the static files to a `build` directory.

### MDX

Imports for mdx files need to be after the `---` section. For example:

```
---
slug: /
title: Getting Started
---

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';
```

## Local SDK setup

You should have a documentation directory structure starting from a `docusaurus` directory in your SDK. Within that there should be a `docs` directory. Within that should be a directory named for your SDK (ex: `iOS` or `Android` or `ReactNative`). All of your markdown documentation should live within that directory and you can feel free to use any additional directory structure you see fit for sectioning your docs. Note: each directory you have will become it's own url path. For instance, if you have this `docusaurus/docs/Android/classes/some-doc.md` file path then the url path for that markdown file will be `{url}/chat/docs/sdk/android/classes/some-doc`. Below is an example of this directory structure. Locally you should only need your individual SDK directory and contents.

![Example Directory Structure](./assets/images/Example_Directory_Structure.png)

The markdown file which you want to be the starting page (ex: `{url}/chat/docs/sdk/android` or `{url}/chat/docs/sdk/ios`) for your SDK docs should have this at the top of the file and be in the root of your doc SDK directory (ex: `docusaurus/docs/Android/example.md` or `docusaurus/docs/iOS/example.md`):

```
---
slug: /
---
```

### Assets

You can add local assets to your docs by adding them within an `assets` folder within your SDK named directory (ex: `docusaurus/docs/Android/assets/some-asset.png`) and then utilize them through local paths within your markdown files. For more info, reference the docusaurus documentation [here](https://docusaurus.io/docs/markdown-features/assets).

### SDK-specific config for `@docusaurus/plugin-content-docs`

We have common configuration of docusaurus docs in `docusaurus/docusaurus.config.js`. To modify the configuration, you can create a plugin file in your docusaurus directory as described above, with one of the plugins using `@docusaurus/plugin-content-docs` as the plugin ID.

The object defined for the plugin will be merged with the default configuration.

For example for React Native, there is a file at `/docusaurus/reactnative-docusaurus-content-docs.plugin.js` with the following content:

```js
module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    [
      "@docusaurus/plugin-content-docs",
      {
        lastVersion: "3.x.x",
        versions: {
          current: {
            label: "4.0.0",
            banner: "unreleased",
            path: "4.0.0",
          },
          "3.x.x": {
            label: "3.x.x",
          },
        },
      },
    ],
  ],
}
```

## Sidebars

You can add your own sidebar instead of the auto-generated default by creating a `sidebars-{SDK_NAME}.(js|json)` file within your `docusaurus` directory. For example on `React` the file would be `sidebars-react.(js|json)` and for `React Native` you would do `sidebars-react-native.(js|json)`.

## Shared content

To share content between multiple SDKs, put markdown files in the `shared` directory. During run, it will be symlinked next to your content.

```sh
- shared
    - <your-shared-file> # this will be symlink to the shared directory
```

Then, import and render the shared content using mdx:

```mdx
import SharedContent from "../../../shared/_example-shared-content.md"

<SharedContent />
```

> NOTE: the [stream-chat-docusaurus website](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-docusaurus/) uses the `staging` branch of `stream-chat-docusaurus-cli` for [its staging deployment](https://staging.getstream.io/chat/docs/sdk/react/). To ensure that the setup works, you need to follow the following workflow:

- Write and test locally shared content using the `staging` branch for `stream-chat-docusaurus-cli` (this repository).
- Commit/push those changes **before committing/pushing** the staging content changes for your SDK.
- Once you're ready to publish to production, _merge_ the staging branch of this repository to production first.
- Then, publish the SDK content as usual.
- Ensure that you monitor and check that the Github workflows have finished successfully.

## Markdown Features Stream theme

Aside from [Docusaurus' components](https://docusaurus.io/docs/next/markdown-features/), you can use our customized components.

### Labels in headers

Labels can be used inside headers to give them emphasis. This will add styles in the Header and ToC.

```md
### <div class="label required">required</div> **Consequat deserunt**
```

> NOTE: It is mandatory to put the `label` **before** your Heading title. See [this](docusaurus/src/css/components/label.scss#L8) for design implementation.

![Example label in markdown header](./assets/images/Example_label_header.png)

And you will also see the following style in the ToC

![Example label in ToC](./assets/images/Example_label_toc.png)

#### Types

Similar to [admonitions/notes](https://docusaurus.io/docs/next/markdown-features/admonitions), we defined 5 label types:

- required
- note
- info
- caution
- success

![Example of label types](./assets/images/Label_types.png)

### Image Showcase

Component created to display images inside a flex container, fully responsive and interactive (hover the images to slightly expand them) out of the box ðŸ™‚

To make use of the `<ImageShowcase />` component, remember to add the correct import at the beginning of your `.mdx` file.

Example of how to use it:

```jsx
import ImageShowcase from "@site/src/components/ImageShowcase"

import channelList from "../assets/channel_list.png"
import messageInput from "../assets/message_input.png"
import messageList from "../assets/message_list.png"

;<ImageShowcase
  items={[
    {
      image: channelList,
      caption: (
        <span>
          <code>ChannelList</code> can be used with no props
        </span>
      ),
      alt: "Example of how to use channelList component",
    },
    { image: messageInput, caption: "Message input design" },
    { image: messageList, caption: "Message list sample" },
  ]}
/>
```

![Example ImageShowcase desktop](./assets/images/Example_showcase.png)

You can also add border to the images using the boolean prop `border` like the following:

```jsx
<ImageShowcase
  border
  items={[
    {
      image: image1,
      caption: <span>Images with border ðŸ™‚</span>,
      alt: "Example of custom message",
    },
    {
      image: image2,
      caption: <span>Another one!</span>,
      alt: "Example of custom message part 2",
    },
  ]}
/>
```

![Example ImageShowcase with border](./assets/images/Example_showcase_border.png)

### Hide page from search

If you're working on a page and want its content to be hidden from our search, you can add the flag `hide_from_search`
to your frontmatter and this file will be ignored during the search indexing:

```jsx
---
slug: /
hide_from_search: true
---
```

## Adding Video

Videos can be added by using the normal html tag. For example, if you would want a video that is centered, you could use the following snippet,

```jsx
import Video from "../assets/video.mp4";

<div style={{ display: "flex", justifyContent: "center" }}>
    <div style={{ width: "270px" }}>
        <video muted controls style={{ maxWidth: "100%" }}>
            <source src={Video} type="video/mp4"/>
            Alas, your browser doesn't support HTML5 video. That's OK! You can still
            <a href={Video}> download the video</a> and watch it with a video player.
        </video>
    </div>
</div>
```

This would show the video centered in the page with control buttons as below. Just make sure you adapt the `width` style property according to your video file.
