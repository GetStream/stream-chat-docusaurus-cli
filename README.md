# Stream Chat Docusaurus CLI

This is a CLI tool to help locally run docusaurus and show SDK documentation

## Local SDK setup

You should have a documentation directory structure starting from a `docusaurus` directory in your SDK. Within that there should be a `docs` directory. Within that should be a directory named for your SDK (ex: `iOS` or `Android` or `React Native`). All of your markdown documentation should live within that directory and you can feel free to use any additional directory structure you see fit for sectioning your docs. Note: each directory you have will become it's own url path. For instance, if you have this `docusaurus/docs/Android/classes/some-doc.md` file path then the url path for that markdown file will be `{url}/chat/docs/sdk/Android/classes/some-doc`. Below is an example of this directory structure. Locally you should only need your individual SDK directory and contents.

The markdown file which you want to be the starting page (ex: `{url}/chat/docs/sdk/Android` or `{url}/chat/docs/sdk/iOS`) for your SDK docs should have this at the top of the file and be in the root of your doc SDK directory (ex: `docusaurus/docs/Android/example.md` or `docusaurus/docs/iOS/example.md`):

```
---
slug: /
---
```

### Assets

You can add local assets to your docs by adding them within an `assets` folder within your SDK named directory (ex: `docusaurus/docs/Android/assets/some-asset.png`) and then utilize them through local paths within your markdown files. For more info, reference the docusaurus documentation [here](https://docusaurus.io/docs/markdown-features/assets).

## Plugins

You can add your own plugins in addition to the default set by creating a `docusaurus{SDK_NAME}.plugin.js` file within your `docusaurus` directory.

## Sidebars

You can add your own sidebar instead of the auto-generated default by creating a `sidebars{SDK_NAME}.json` file within your `docusaurus` directory. For example on `React` the file would be `sidebarsReact.json` and for SDKs with spaces within their names like `React Native` you would do `sidebarsReactNative.json`.

## Installation and Using the CLI
 
`yarn global add stream-chat-docusaurus-cli` or `npm install -g stream-chat-docusaurus-cli`

Within the same directory level of your SDK that the `docusaurus` directory described above lives you can run CLI commands. Make sure you have at least the directory structure described above as well as at least 1 markdown file.

*Haven't published yet so this won't install from npm/yarn so instead you can clone this locally and navigate to this folder and just do `npm install -g`*

### Initializing

To initialize the docusaurus setup (which you will need to always do before anything else), you can utilize `npx` and run this command `npx stream-chat-docusaurus -i`. If there are any custom packages you need to install for custom plugin setups you can utilize the `-c` option and add a comma separated list of packages that will be installed on initialization (ex: `npx stream-chat-docusaurus -i -c=docusaurus-plugin-typedoc,typedoc,typedoc-plugin-markdown,typescript`).

### Starting

To locally run the docusaurus setup and see your documentation you can run `npx stream-chat-docusaurus -s`. This command can be chained with the `-i` initialization command in 1 step by running `npx stream-chat-docusaurus -i -s`.

### Versioning

To cut a new version of your docs simply type in `npx stream-chat-docusaurus -nv NEW_VERSION SDK_NAME` like this: `npx stream-chat-docusaurus -nv 2.0.0-rc.0 ReactNative`.

### Building

To locally build your docusaurus static files to see if it succeeds you should run `npx stream-chat-docusaurus -b`. The `-b` flag builds the static files.

### MDX

Imports for mdx files need to be after the `---` section. For example:

```
---
slug: /
title: Getting Started
---

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';
```
